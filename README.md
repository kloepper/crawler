# crawler
## Problem
Write a simple web crawler.

## Design process
Write code quickly to understand the problem space. It is difficult to really begin to understand a problem unless there is some solution available to crique (no matter how inefficient or naieve).

By writing code to try out designs a base of functional knowledge is established that can quickly be used to pivot the final solution. Beyond solving the target problem exercise programming increases the programmers ability to represent a solution more accuately and with less time spent writing code.

Often rewriting a simple algorithm in several differnt languages helps to understand the really structure of the algorithm apart from any language syntax. This allows the concrete implementaion in each language to be improved.

## Possible solutions
### Bash
Using composition of command line utilities is a great way to get something working quickly. It both gives a simple reference implementation as well as catching many corner cases when using well established utilities. The disadvantages typically have to do with overall performance as well as very high costs to customize the solution (which also typically makes the script increasingly brittle).
